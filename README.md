## 📌 Overview

This project implements a searchable list of user profile cards.  
It demonstrates practical front-end patterns including:

- Efficient DOM templating using `<template>`
- Debounced search input for performance
- Real-time filtering without external libraries
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- Responsive grid layout with graceful scaling

The app is intentionally lightweight and framework-free, making it easy to integrate into any static website or project.

## ⚙️ Implementation Notes

### 🔍 Search Algorithm  

Filtering is handled on the client side using a case-insensitive match:

```js
users.filter(user =>
  user.name.toLowerCase().includes(q) ||
  user.role.toLowerCase().includes(q) ||
  user.bio.toLowerCase().includes(q)
);
```

### 🖼 Rendering  

Cards are generated by cloning a `<template>` element for consistent structure and fast DOM rendering.

### ⚡ Performance  

- Search input is **debounced (150ms)**  
- Reduces layout thrashing during typing  
- Optimized DOM updates  

### ♿ Accessibility  

- Live result updates using `aria-live="polite"`  
- Keyboard-focusable cards  
- Visible focus states  
- Descriptive alt text on images

## 📸 Screenshots / Preview

This app uses **dynamic random images** from the Picsum API:

```
https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=2
```

Because each reload generates a new image, **static screenshots are not included**.

> Every card image changes on each page load based on the `?random` parameter.
